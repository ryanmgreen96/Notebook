My biggest issue with ROTS is Anakin's apparent insanity, or irrationality rather, of how the Jedi are, and his place in contrast to them. He's just there too quick.
I console myself though, and accept, that he's simply admitted himself to this path, this mantra, of dark  deeds, of destroying the seperatists unremoursefully. 
If we consider that, then the picture becomes a bit clear. For he has this new found strenght, and thus confidence in what he can do. The novelty, or at least newness of it, is what brings him, in calmer states, to see oppertunity. As if, upon killing the Seperatits, then speaking with Padme, he obivously is well and speaking to her, but as if he had a bunch of cash behind him --which his dark deeds brought-- he says lets go spend it. And he is absolutely pissed when Obi Won rains down on his parade. "As if he cant stand the grandstanding, moral obediance which he feels from Obi Won, in this matter." It's similar to fictional marriages, where the parents don't like the bad boy the girl likes, and so they conjure some trick to take her. Anakin has gone off, and by his accounts, which, again, are based on his admittence to the wrongness of the Jedi, done what is right, and powerfully. He says to Padme, 'im doing this for you'. Her rebuke of this has him peaved, as if he's being lectured; Obi Won being brought up exasterbates. Maybe his doubts make him aware that his actions are not so purily right, and so he digs even deeper into how right they are. Obi Won showing up is like, 'alright Padme, lets leave this guy'.  
I think overall, when Anakin exclaims that Padme has brought Obi to kill him, its telling that he is so off in his own world, full of himself, that he is so important that Obi Won is clearly hear on some mission regarding him. His lines are stiff, but he essentially says, 'you don't know what I see, what I've done, what I've become. And you think you can stop me, try'. 

I must mention the Jedi in all of this. For their part is one of complacency, in that, of what is right, so are they the status. To put it plainly, they fear the control that Palpatine has over the Senate. They are not evil, but blinded to their own wish to control. "We want power, but for good, and in a good manner." ///
Its important to state that the council --Obi, Mace and Yoda-- explicitly doubt Anakin's claim as the chosen one. They don't trust him, and Yoda says they may have misread the prophecy. The idea here, is that the Jedi have an ideal, and Anakin is suppose to reach it and destroy the contrast to it-the sith. But Anakin want's things, is in love and afraid, and finds guidance in the Sith to achieve this. The Jedi, in their doubts, push Anakin away, in terms of  not tempering his inner desire, nor enlightening him as not to fally prey to Palpatine's  'offer'.


Anakin's whole goal is to save Padme. The Jedi are a hinderence to this, as he can't admitt it. He want's to  do good though, without question. Thus, he is in toil: for as far as he is concerned, it is not good to love Padme.  When I sees the hypocrisy of the Jedi, he accepts Palpatine's training.. The course he runs then, is one , where he has become dark and anti-jedi, with the hope of saving Padme. As it were, he returns to her after slaughtering everyone at the temple, and he seems fine. He realizes though, upon defeating the seperatist, how powerful he is, 'as if he's let his engine rip'. He can't see that he's blind to what he initially sought, at least the general good he wished to do. Padme can't accept this. And in his attempt to save her, or become what he believes is strong enough to save her --a mistake, that Palpatine sold to him, and the Jedi could not overt him from-- his Sith passion and ego come about, and he looses sight that, it is not merely Padme he wishes to save, but the Republic. The Jedi were a hinderance to this; he sought to be good, as the Jedi saw it, but also love Padme. He lost the former in his evil deeds, aimed at overcoming the fear of losing padme. So she turns away. He hates Obi Won for this, 'always so reasonable,', which Anakin sees through, that such things are a farce. His passion though blinds him to his weakness: he believes he is all powerful and bade for the glory of this. The root of his loss

The biggest issue, or least clear elment of ROTS, is Obi Wons surprise at Anakin's turn. There isn't enough time for him to be shocked, and restle with that.  He shows up on Mustufar, and speaks to him as if he's a boy lashing out. He never gets angry. He seems to just understand. 
Part of this is relieved by seeing both their time together earlier,recognizing that Obi Won knew Anakin was frusturated. Anakin was left to his own, taken by Sidious, and Obi Won has to realize this. He does exclaim, 'I've failed you Anakin', noting how it is his fault for  letting Anakin go off. There just wasn't enough disparity between the two for Obi Won to find any of this sensible. "Your lust for power," says he, but based on what? All we've seen is Obi watching the security recording of Anakin killing younglings and bowing to Sidious. How does he know Anakin's  state of mind --I dont even think he knows he's killed the seperatists. A loose thread in the movie is Anakin's want of power, beyond his fear of losing Padme. And Obi asserting this, as if he recognizes it in him. Anakin does say, 'my new empire', which Obi then speaks about his apparent want of power. Anakin is just so in his head, and Obi just says this is ridiuclous, but right as there about to fight. He never challenges Anakin, attempting to bring him back. He's just accepted it.
